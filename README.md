👋🏽 Hi, my name is Noumana Haq.

🎓 Soon to be grad with a Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering from Brunel University London (June 2023).

🌇 Passion for taking initiative in work and group collaborations.

📚 I have done work experience at UCL where I built bio-inspired robots i.e. I built caterpillar form robot, visited companies like IBM and Google Deep Mind which enhanced my logical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as boosted my creativity skills. Furthermore, I have worked with Ahmadiyya Muslim Community (AMC) by volunteering under the subtitling department because it combines various skills such as teamwork, organisation, communication as well as critical thinking and motivation.

💻 As for my future, I hope to complete a Masters degree in Applied Mathematics and one day work as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and work with a diverse team.

🏔 My hobbies include reading as well as with the current on-going pandemic, I have also chosen to take online classes and do watercolour paintings as form to express my feelings. 

💪🏽 My strengths and skills include working with HTML5, CSS3, WordPress Blogging, Python, Java, C++, MATLAB as well as Operating Systems and Urdu.
